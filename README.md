## Inspiration
I came across Prof. Dr. Altaf Samo’s website and wanted to redesign it with a modern, interactive approach — transforming a static layout into a story-driven experience that flows smoothly with animations.

## About the Project
This redesign is not just a layout upgrade; it’s a complete reimagination of how information can be presented through storytelling and motion.  
It demonstrates how subtle animations and smart UI/UX design can make a professional website feel more human and dynamic.
